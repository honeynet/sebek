Note:

  This describes the version 3.x linux sebek client, version 3 uses a new
  packet format which is not backwards compatable. You need to use a 3.x 
  of the Server to be compatable.  Also note that this new server along
  with a new web UI named Walleye are part of the new honeywall ISO.

Theory of operation:

  Sebek uses techniques similar to those used by LKM based rootkits.  There is 
  one module, sebek.o, that overrides the sys_read, sys_socket and sys_open call
  to collect interesting data.  Once the data is collected, this module exports 
  this data over the network to a remote host.  Sebek.o also modifies the behavior 
  of the kernel to prevent the discovery of the packets it is transmitting. The 
  second module, cleaner.o is used to hide the presence of the sebek.o module.  A 
  detailed history of changes for this package is provided in the ChangeLog file.


Building Sebek:

Prior to building ensure that the the /usr/src/linux-2.4 points to the proper 
version of the kernel source. It should be noted that sebek must be built 
against the exact version you intend to run sebek on. Finally the kernel must not only be decompressed but also configured and the dependencies resolved ('make {x|old|menu}config ' and 'make dep').

To build sebek, do the following:

  - ./configure
  - make

After successful building, a binary tarball will be generated in 
the source directory ex. sebek-linux-3.x.x.tar .  This tarball is all
that one need to copy on to the honeypot.

The configure script has two options that may be of use to you:

  --with-kernel_source_dir=DIR  Use kernel sources located at DIR
  --with-gcc=FILE  Use gcc compiler located at FILE



Configuring Sebek:

when configuring the sebek module there are 9 parameters that need to be 
defined in upper portion of the sbk_install.sh script.

 - DESTINATION_MAC
 
	This sets the destination address to use in the Ethernet header

 - DESTINATION_IP
	
	This sets the destination address to use in the IP header

 - DESTINATION_PORT

	This defines the destination UDP number to use. THIS NEEDS to be defined.


 - SOURCE_PORT

	This defines the source UDP number to use. This is optional. 


 - MAGIC Value
	
	This defines the value used in conjunction with the DESTINATION_PORT to 
	determine which packets to hide.  THIS NEEDS to be defined in the config.

 
 - INTERFACE
	
	This specifies which interface sebek packets should be exported from.

 - KEYSTROKE_ONLY

	This determines how much data sebek collects, if this is set, then 
	only reads of length 1 are collected.  This corresponds to interactive 
	sessions that echo characters.  If this NOT set then ALL read calls
	are recorded.

- SOCKET_TRACKING

	This determines if sebek reports on socket activty such as Connect and
	Accept actions. If set to 0, socket tracking is disabled.


 - TESTING

	This controls the hiding of the sebek module itself.  If this is set
	then the install script will not hide the sebek module, allowing you
    	to rmmod it later.

 
 - MODULE_NAME

	Allows you to change the name of the module as installed into the system.
	Even though the module is hidden there are artifacts left in memory
	that reference the module name.   If you leave this variable blank, a
	random name is selected.   Names should include the .o suffix.


Running:  

  All files for sebek are in the same directory, within that
  directory is sbk_install.sh.  sbk_install.sh is the script that contains the 
  sebek configuration and the commands to properly install sebek.

  Once you have edited sebek.sh according to you desires and make it
  executable, its a matter of executing ./sbk_install.sh and the fun
  begins.

  Please keep in mind that the linux client is a kernel module, and
  unless you install it from a startup script, upon a reboot sebek 
  will no longer be installed.

Uninstalling:

  Sebek can be uninstalled ONLY if TESTING is set.  If it is set then
  the Cleaner module will not be installed and you can remove the sebek
  module through the use of the rmmod command.  


Review of Best Practices:

  As an open source technology, it is most likely impossible to
  develop a version of Sebek that can not be detected once an attacker
  gains privileged access.  For more information on the risks and 
  issues facing honeynets, refer to:

       Know Your Enemy: Honeynets
	    http://www.honeynet.org/papers/honeynet

  Independent of the client implementation there are some practices
  that we recommend to minimize the risk in this specific case:

    1.   It is recommended that you run sbk_extract in a chroot 
         environment protected with Systrace and, if available,  
         your favorite flavor of stack protection.  This 
         recommendation applies to all data capture tools run on
         a honeynet.


    2.   To decrease the likelihood of detection, it is recommended 
         that you modify the source of Sebek so that it is different 
         from that which is publicly available.  

    3.   In typical deployments where Data Capture occurs on a 
         bridging firewall, it is recommended that the Sebek client 
         be configured to send packets to the IP and MAC address of 
         the default gateway.  By doing this, even if an intruder 
         recovers the configuration,  the only information 
         disclosed is the magic value, and destination port number.
         When possible DO NOT configure the IP or MAC address of 
         the server into the Sebek Client.


Testing:

  Sebek has been tested on the following systems:

  - Redhat EL3
	2.4.20-21

  - Redhat 9.0 
	2.4.20-8smp running on dual athlon
 
  - Redhat 8.0 
	2.4.18-27-7 running on vmware box

  - Redhat 7.3
	2.4.18-3 running on laptop with aironet340 card or orinoco gold
	
  


Bugs:

  currently there is a problem with removing sebek.o after insmod.  
  The problem is related to the fact that after module removal, there is
  no longer a valid raw socket implementation and this causes some
  kernel stability issues.  This causes kernel oops at system shutdown
  and may also cause problems if you try to run tcpdump after rmmoding
  sebek.  

  There is also a problem with processes that are blocking on a read
  causing an oops after then are reawakened.  

  Some systems that have been patched for the kmod/ptrace vuln seem to 
  not be working well with sebek. This seems to be based on which patch is
  used.  For instance the STD patch for redhat 8.0 and 7.3 seems to work
  just fine.


  Running on Althon CPUs:

  It has been recently discovered that sebek doesnt seem to be stable on some
  AMD systems.  I have only tested this on dual athlon box.  The problem can be
  triggered by running tcpdump on a sebeked host.   The kernel panics with the
  af_packet code trying to call function using a bad function pointer.  We are still
  investigating the cause of this one.
